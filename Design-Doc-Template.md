### Technical Stack

This section should be an overview of the languages, libraries, and frameworks that you've used in this project. The technical stack should describe exactly why and how the specific tools were chosen and used. This section should also provide a walkthrough of how your project works, accounting for possible user actions and implementation logic.

### User Interface Design + Project Demonstrations

This is the section where you show off your work! Include screenshots, pictures, videos, and links that describe how your project works! If you're creating a software project, this is the place where you link a QuickTime screen recording of how your product works!

### Outstanding Issues & Further Considerations

Are there any leftover bugs? Were there features that you were hoping to explore, but just didn't have enough time to implement it within the development timeline? Describe them here.

The format should be as follows:
1. A single sentence identifying the problem or feature
2. A 4-5 sentence paragraph describing the utility that would result from resolving this issue.
3. Links to any commits, codebases, or online resource that could provide a potential solution. Make sure to include at least one link!
